# CI

The example workflow discovers build targets dynamically:

- ESP-IDF projects are discovered from `examples/esp-idf/*/CMakeLists.txt`.
- Arduino sketches are discovered from `.ino` files under `examples/arduino/`, excluding `examples/arduino/libraries/**`.

`workflow_dispatch` accepts `all`, an example directory name, or a repo-relative path. This allows maintainers to run the full matrix or a single example.

Current CI matrix:

- ESP-IDF `v5.5.4` and `v6.0.2`, target `esp32s3`.
- Arduino-ESP32 core `3.3.10`, FQBN `esp32:esp32:esp32s3`, using bundled libraries from `examples/arduino/libraries`.

Each successful ESP-IDF and Arduino matrix build uploads a flashable firmware artifact. Download the artifact zip from the workflow run, extract it, then run `flash.sh` or `flash.bat` with the board serial port.

If an example requires hardware, credentials, or an upstream component that is not yet compatible with a selected framework version, document the exclusion here before excluding it from CI.
